# Advent of Code Solutions - Java

This repository contains my solutions to the Advent of Code challenges implemented in Java. Each day, I attempt to solve a new coding problem provided by the [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) platform as a way to practice and improve my Java programming skills.

## Structure

- Each day's solution is organized into a separate Java class named `DayX.java`, where `X` represents the day number.
- Inside each class, you'll find the solution code along with any supporting methods or classes.
- Input files for each day's problem are stored in the `inputs` directory, named `dayX.txt`, where `X` represents the day number.
- If additional libraries or dependencies are required, they will be documented in this README file.

## How to Run

To run the solutions:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Open the project in your preferred Java IDE or editor.
3. Navigate to the `src` directory.
4. Open the solution file for the specific day you want to run (e.g., `Day1.java`).
5. Run the `main` method.

Make sure you have the necessary Java development environment set up on your machine.
